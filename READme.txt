The repo contains two folders: other and uniprojects.

"Other" contains a couple of small python programs I wrote in my spare time. They require Python v2.7 to run. 
The first, "prime_tester" is a program with a visual interface that will tell if your number is prime or not.
The second, "randomImg", is a program that will switch all .jpg image titles in the current folder with a random
string, written for a friend.

"uniprojects" contains code from projects that I did throughout my university course. There is a folder for each
respective year. 
"2017" contains:
	"IFB104 Assignment 1", a python program that draws an album cover using python's turtle module, 
	"CAB201 Assignment" which contains a C# Visual Studio implementation of a tank shooting game, 
	"CAB202 Teensy Game", a C file written to run on the Teensy Microcontroller containing a complex game that involves 
	climbing an infinite walled tower, killing monsters, and collecting points and weapons.
	"IFB130", a folder that contains various SQL scripts, architecture diagrams, and other miscellaneous
	database related material.
 
"2018" contains "hotspot website", a proper website that users can login, register, and search and review 
hotspots around brisbane, "minesweeper threaded server" a C minesweeper game that can be hosted on a server
that allows up to 10 people to play different iterations of the game, and "store app", a Java program that 
exports store manifests.
"2019" contains "CAB301ass1" and "CAB301ass2", both C# programs that test the algorithm efficiency of one and 
two algorithms respectively.
